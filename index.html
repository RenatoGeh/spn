<p>
  Sum-Product Networks are a new class of tractable Probabilistic Graphical Models that can compute
  inference in time linear to its edges. It was proposed in 2011 by Hoifung Poon and Pedro Domingos
  on their paper <i>Sum-Product Networks: A New Deep Architecture</i>
  <a href="articles/SPN_New_Deep_Arch-Domingos_Poon.pdf">[PD2011]</a> and has shown great promise
  in probabilistic learning.
</p>

<p>
  This undergraduate research project's objective is to not only understand what Sum-Product
  Networks are and how to perform inference and learning on them, but also log what I have learned
  in a step-by-step form, allowing others to learn about Sum-Product Networks in a much easier way.
